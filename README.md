# Final Project (Fall 2022)

### 1. Purpose of Analysis
 The project aimed to create the best Credit Scoring System (CSS) by using Naive Bayes Classifier & Support Vector Machine in  he scikit-learn library for Python.

### 2. Process of Analysis
   * Analysis Tools 
     <br/> Python (libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, mtplotlit and sklearn)
   * Data
     - Lending Club Loan data

   * Analysis
     - In the data-processing part, removed unnecessary variables, conducted kNN missing value imputation, and etc.
     - With hyperparameter tuning, compared Logistic Regression's performance which is used as CSS model in the industry with Naive Bayes Classifier's by using sklearn pacakage. 

### 3. Result of Analysis
 Logistic Regression shows higher performance than Naive Bayes Classifier.

### 4. What I learned
   * I took entire data analysis process, including problem identification, data collection and preprocessing, data modeling, visualization, and exploration.
   * I refined, analyzed and visualized data using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.
